This function, often accompanied by zoom controls, enables you to modify how the video fits your screen, particularly useful for content that doesn't natively match your display's aspect ratio. Additionally, the Picture in Picture (PiP) mode complements this by allowing you to watch these adjusted videos in a floating window, facilitating multitasking without missing any content."
